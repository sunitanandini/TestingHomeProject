# Testing Project for The Great Courses : https://www.thegreatcourses.com/


As part of this project I wrote test cases in Java using Selenium to test for user Buying cycle.

I have used the POM and we can put any course name in the BuyACourseTestScript page to search for the different courses.

This inlcudes:

Landing on the home page
Looking for Science Catogory to select from
Search 'The Night Sky' course
Choose the format 
Add to the cart
And make the payment

Test Cases can be found here:
